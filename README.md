# Inventory-tracker ðŸ—ƒ

A way to track Inventory in a simple way for storage. Right now I'm still in the planning stage of this project will have an outline of how to use the api created and a way to add the to what is in the inventory delete from the inventory and check in and out of the inventory.
<br>
I plan on using a rasberry pi or arduino mega to scan barcodes and check againts the inventory. I also plan on adding a way for the inventory to have items added and removed throught the website and adding a barcode creator so that it is possible to a print of the barcodes from the website. As well as create new ones if old ones get distroyed.

## API Documentaion

This is where the documentaion of the api that I create will go including the creation of the docker file and every single thing I installed to create a REST API for the tracking of the inventory.
